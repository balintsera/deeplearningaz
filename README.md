# Deep Learning AZ source codes

This is the source code I wrote while studying the Udemy course: Deep Learning A-Z https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/learn/v4/content

There's a docker-compose file that activates a Jupyter environment to run the code within. After starting the docker container, you can run these .py files using VSCode's Pythonn and Jupyter plugin. Just set up the Jupyter url from the menu.

Before running the files with VSCode, install keras and tensorflow `pip install keras tensorflow`.

At the current image version `apt-get update && apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx -y` is also needed.
